# DSC 100: Introduction to Data Management



## Description:

Databases are at the heart of modern commercial application development. Their use extends beyond this to many other environments and domains where large amounts of data must be stored for efficient update, retrieval, and analysis. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to data management, covering topics such as the relational data model, SQL, formal query languages, query evaluation, data storage and indexes, NoSQL databases, conceptual design, integrity constraints, design theory, normal forms, and data quality. Through a combination of lectures, demos, and hands-on exercises, students will gain a strong foundation in database management concepts and practices, with a focus on the use of SQL and the relational model. The course begins with an overview of course organization and an introduction to the relational data model, followed by lessons on SQL basics and different types of joins in SQL. In the following weeks, students will learn advanced SQL queries, formal query languages, and query evaluation. The course also covers topics related to data storage and indexing, including hard disk and file organization, index organization, and creating indexes in SQL. In the latter half of the course, students will study NoSQL databases, conceptual design, integrity constraints, and design theory, culminating in a discussion of normal forms. The course includes a discussion of data quality, including techniques for dealing with missing data and entity deduplication. Upon completing the course, students will be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary for designing, querying, and maintaining a relational database.

## Course Workload
**(subject to change)**

**Homework (40%):** There will be weekly homeworks consisting of written problem-solving and programming assignments (35%) and web quizzes (5%). The purpose of the homeworks is to provide students with the opportunity to apply and practice the concepts and skills learned in the lectures. Homeworks will be more rigorous than the web quizzes and will require students to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the material. The purpose of the web quizzes is to help students reinforce their understanding of the course material by answering review questions based on the previous lectures. The following is a list of the homeworks and web quizzes in the course:

- Homework 1: SQLITE and SQL Basics
- Homework 2: Basic SQL Queries
- Completion of Postgres Setup for Homework 3
- Homework 3: Advanced SQL and PostgreSQL
- Homework 4: Relational Algebra
- Homework 5: Entity Relationship Diagrams and Conceptual Design
- Web Quiz 1: Data Models and Basic SQL
- Web Quiz 2: SQL Aggregates
- Web Quiz 3: Advanced SQL
- Web Quiz 4: Relational Algebra
- Web Quiz 5: Query Evaluation and Indexes
- Web Quiz 6: Conceptual Design and Design Theory
- Web Quiz 7: Data Quality

**Due dates:**  Please note that the due dates for both the homework assignments and web quizzes can be found on the Canvas calendar. Additionally, the homework assignment due dates are also available on the course webpage calendar (below). Web quizzes are due on Mondays of the following week in which they are released.

**Note:** Homework assignments can be completed in teams of size 2. This means that you can work with one other student to complete the assignment and submit a single solution. It is expected that each member of the team will contribute equally to the solution and have a thorough understanding of the material. Collaboration is encouraged as it can help deepen understanding and facilitate learning, but it is important that all team members understand the work being submitted and are able to explain it if necessary. Plagiarism and cheating will not be tolerated and will result in disciplinary action.

**Late Day Policy:** You have up to 3 late days to use on homework assignments. These late days can be used in 24-hour chunks. You can only use one late day on each assignment. Late days are meant to be a safety net and should not be used as a convenience. It is expected that you will not need to use your late days and that you will submit all assignments on time. If you use all of your late days, it is likely that you are not managing your time effectively and will need to adjust your study habits. **Please note that no excuses for not submitting assignments on time will be accepted once you have exhausted your late days.**


**Midterm (20%):** The midterm exam will cover all topics up until Formal Query Languages. It will be held on canvas.

**Final Exam (35%):** The final exam will be comprehensive and will be held on canvas.

**Class Participation (5%):**  Involves answering questions with the slido.

Both Midterm and Final exam will be held remote.

**Exam Dates:**

- Midterm Exam: November 7, 2023
- Final Exam: December 14, 2023


**Extra Credit:**

- Some homeworks have extra credit questions.
- Large number of good answers on Piazza.

## Grading Scheme

The grading scheme is a hybrid of absolute and relative grading. The absolute cutoffs are based on your absolute total score. The relative bins are based on your position in the total score distribution of the class. The better grade among the two (absolute-based and relative-based) will be your final grade.

| Grade | Absolute Cutoff (>=) | Relative Bin (Use strictest) |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| A+    | 97                   | Highest 5%                    |
| A     | 94                   | Next 10% (5-15)               |
| A-    | 91                   | Next 15% (15-30)              |
| B+    | 85                   | Next 15% (30-45)              |
| B     | 80                   | Next 15% (45-60)              |
| B-    | 70                   | Next 15% (60-75)              |
| C+    | 65                   | Next 5% (75-80)               |
| C     | 60                   | Next 5% (80-85)               |
| C-    | 55                   | Next 5% (85-90)               |
| D     | 50                   | Next 5% (90-95)               |
| F     | < 50                 | Lowest 5%                     |


## Textbook

Although a textbook is not required in the course, the following textbook is optional and recommended. Lecture slides and recorded videos would be sufficient for this class.

Database Systems: The Complete Book, by Hector Garcia-Molina, Jeffrey D. Ullman, and Jennifer Widom. 2nd Edition. Prentice Hall. 2008.

## Canvas

All weekly homework assignments and web quizzes should be turned in via Canvas.

## Communication

All important announcements will be sent through Canvas.

## Piazza

All questions that may be of general interest to the class should be directed to Piazza. You will get your questions answered faster on Piazza than via personal emails to the instructional team, because Piazza is monitored closely by everybody in the class, not just the course staff. You are highly encouraged to answer each other's questions on Piazza (you will get extra credit for the number of good answers on Piazza!) and the 
instructional team would endorse/add to those answers.



*Note:*  Some slides are adopted from the UW database group.
